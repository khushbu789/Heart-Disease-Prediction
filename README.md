The **Heart Disease Prediction** project aims to leverage machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on a range of health indicators. With heart disease being a leading cause of death worldwide, early detection is essential for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. By developing a predictive model, this project helps healthcare professionals identify at-risk individuals and implement preventive measures.

The dataset used in this project contains various features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, physical activity, and a history of heart disease in the family. These factors are all known to contribute to the risk of developing heart disease. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can process this data and predict whether an individual is likely to have heart disease.

For this project, four different machine learning models were employed: **Logistic Regression**, **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**. These models were chosen due to their popularity and effectiveness in classification tasks. The models were trained using labeled data, with the outcome (whether the individual had heart disease or not) known, and the algorithms learned to identify patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable.

The models were evaluated based on **accuracy**, which is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. After training and testing all four models, it was found that **Gaussian Naive Bayes** performed the best, achieving an accuracy of **85.5%**. This indicates that the Gaussian Naive Bayes model was able to correctly predict heart disease in 85.5% of cases in the test dataset, making it the most reliable model among the ones used.

The project also involved several important preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, normalizing the data, and performing feature selection. These steps are critical for improving the performance of machine learning models, as they ensure the data is clean and consistent.

In conclusion, the Heart Disease Prediction project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to healthcare, offering an effective and efficient way to predict heart disease risk. By utilizing historical medical data and powerful algorithms, the model has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and providing timely treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The 85.5% accuracy achieved by the Gaussian Naive Bayes model highlights its strong performance and suitability for this type of predictive task.
